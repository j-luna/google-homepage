As part of the Odin Project Foundations course, the goal of this project is to build a decent enough clone of the Google webpage. 

I focused on making sure that most links went to their actual destinations, and also paid particular attention to the ways in which styling changes when the cursor is placed over an element (e.g. box shadow, outlines, etc.). I probably went a little too crazy with flex boxes and made things harder than they had to be, but I was mostly interested in figuring out how these things work. So there ya go!
